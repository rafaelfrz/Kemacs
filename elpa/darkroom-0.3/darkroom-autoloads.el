Remove visual distractions and focus on writing. When this

mode is active, everything but the buffer's text is elided from
view. The buffer margins are set so that text is centered on
screen. Text size is increased (display engine allowing) by
`darkroom-text-scale-increase'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Darkroom mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable
the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `darkroom-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

(autoload 'darkroom-tentative-mode "darkroom" "\
Enters `darkroom-mode' when all other windows are deleted.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`DarkRoom-Tentative mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable
the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.
